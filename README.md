# PHPSocket.IO-android

PHPSocket.IO-android is a library project to enable android developers integrate PHPSocket.IO into their applications faster and easier.

## Dependencies
* http://www.koushikdutta.com/AndroidAsync (at least version 2.0+)

## Set up Instructions
Set up the project dependencies. To use this library in your project, you have two options:

(1) Add this the most [recent jar](http://dhtml.github.io/phpsocket.io/bin/phpsocketio.jar)  to your project's lib and modify your gradle dependency as shown below:
```shell
 dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'com.koushikdutta.async:androidasync:2.+'
    compile files('libs/phpsocketio.jar')
 }
```

(2) Use the GitHub source and include that as a module dependency by following these steps:
 * Clone this library into a project named phpsocketio, parallel to your own application project:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/dhtml/phpsocketio-android.git PHPSocketIOLibrary
```
 * In the root of your application's project edit the file "settings.gradle" and add the following lines:
```shell
include ':PHPSocketIOLibrary'
project(':PHPSocketIOLibrary').projectDir = new File('../PHPSocketIOLibrary/')
```
 * In your application's main module (usually called "app"), edit your build.gradle to add a new dependency:
```shell
 dependencies {
    ...
    compile project(':PHPSocketIOLibrary')
 }
```
Now your project is ready to use this library
